# Noise-reduction-using-basic-adaptive-filtering-with-SNR
Noise reduction has been one of the main problems in signal processing.  Specially when we are dealing with different types of noises. In real life one signal  can be corrupted by different noises, implying that one approach to reduce them  wouldn’t be enough.  The goal of noise reduction methods is to increase the quality of the signal. But  how can we measure the quality? This is not the only question. The other  questions can be:  “What kind of noises can corrupt our signal?”   “What approaches can be taken regarding the noise type?”  In this project we will focus only on speech signals.  Two main types of noises will be introduced here. White and babble noise.   We will show that the approach taken to reduce the white noise can not be a  good option to deal with babble noise. This method is called Butterworth filter  which is a basic band-pass filter and the other one is Kalman filter.  In order to compute the quality of our signals we will use WADA algorithm which  is an estimation of SNR or Signal to Noise Ratio.
